# config files

* Need to write this description
* Need to update all colors to match the same schema (use wpgtk for this, it's based on pywal; or just use pywal you lazy fuck!). Remember everything needs to match. i3, polybar, rofi, thunar and X.
* Consider switching to Kitty (fucking cute name for a terminal emulator!) or Alacritty
* Consider switching to bspwm, awesomewm or dwm?
