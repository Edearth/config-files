Update: I moved to a nother distro, desktop environment and everything, so I no longer need most of these configs. I should probably delete this and start over.

I think it was cool to learn how to make all this. I'm keeping this repo public in case someone finds a use in any of the scripts. I should probably keep the git history if I get around to starting this over.
