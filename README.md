Config files I use in my desktop computer and laptop. There are quality of life
features like:
- Smooth scrolling on Firefox
- Enable window tiling for Discord and Godot
- Random scripts (check out "Scripts/proton", it's great to run Windows games
  downloaded from itch!)
- Default vim config to show line numbers and enable syntax highlighting
- Solarized theme for the terminal emulator kitty

It was cool to learn how to make all this work. The history shows a lot of
misguided attempts to make an i3 desktop to work, all with custom scripts to
show battery life, volume and an emoji selector. I'm keeping this in the repo
in case someone finds a use in any of that. It also shows I didn't wait to
learn, I learned by making annoying mistakes and piling them up until I decided
to try again ðŸ˜‚
